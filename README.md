# Project Crazy Ivan

![](https://travis-ci.org/AO-StreetArt/CrazyIvan.svg?branch=master)

## Overview

Crazy Ivan is a service designed to store 'scenes', with relationships between them
expressed as 4x4 matrices.  These are relationships between coordinate systems, to which
each scene is associated.  This allows for establishing relationships between devices in real-space.

Features:
* Storage of Scenes (Groups of virtual objects & user devices associated to a latitude/longitude)
* Efficient calculation of coordinate system transformations based on existing data
* Means to store manual corrections from users
* Connect to other services over Zero MQ using Google Protocol Buffers.
* Scalable microservice design

Crazy Ivan is a part of the AO Distributed Visualization Server, along with [CLyman] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/CLyman) and [Ex38] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/Ex38).  It therefore utilizes the [DVS Interface library] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/DvsInterface), also available on github.  It utilizes the Scene.proto file for inbound communications.
