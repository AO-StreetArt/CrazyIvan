Deployment
==========

Note: At this time, CrazyIvan has no built-in security or encryption mechanisms.  Until such time, it is not recommended to deploy CrazyIvan in Production.

The easiest methodology of deployment for CrazyIvan is using Docker.  At this time, it has not been tested with either Docker Compose or Docker Swarm.

This page will be updated after larger scale testing has been performed with CrazyIvan.
