Security
========

Crazy Ivan has several forms of security, with one form for transactions (HTTP API),
and another form for events (UDP API).

Transactions
------------

Transactional Security utilizes SSL and Basic Auth over HTTP (HTTPS).  The username/password
can be configured in the application configuration, and SSL will require a valid server
key and certificate.  The locations can then be entered into the ssl.properties file.

The following commands can be used to generate a self-signed SSL cert, along with
a client cert.  This can be used to test the secured transactional setup.

`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout caKey.key -out caCert.pem -days 365`

`openssl genrsa -out clientKey.key 2048`

`openssl req -new -key clientKey.key -out clientCert.csr`

`openssl x509 -req -in clientCert.csr -CA caCert.pem -CAkey caKey.key -CAcreateserial -out MyClient1.crt -days 1024 -sha256`

Events
------

UDP Events utilize AES encryption, with the key and salt set in the application configuration.
